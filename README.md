bootstrap-tabs-ie7
==================

This is just a quick test case for making tabs work in Internet Explorer 7 when using the Angular UI Bootstrap tabs.

After getting the code to render tabs and content the CSS had to be fixed. Check the source to see the dirty CSS applied for IE7 only. There is probably a lot more to be done in order to shape it up.

One can check the file directly in IE7 using this link:
